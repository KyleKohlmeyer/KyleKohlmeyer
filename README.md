### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# I am a student in the Northwestern Data Science and Visualization Bootcamp
# Please check out my repositories to see some of the cool assignments and projects I have worked on as a part of the class

## About me
# I graduated with a biochemistry degree (American Chemical Society certified) from Valparaiso University in 2022. After attending a year of chemistry graduate school at Indiana University, I decided that I wanted to shift to doing more data analytics work rather than conducting experiments in the lab. Thus, I decided to enroll in the Northwestern Data Science bootcamp, and it has been the best decision of my life! I enjoy coding and working with data, and there is nothing more satifying than when your code finally works and outputs what you want. 

## Bootcamp projects summary
# In the Northwestern Bootcamp, I have:
# Created a VBA script to analyze stock data in Excel and apply formatting, saving time on the data analysis for large Excel datasets with multiple sheets
# Used Python and the Open Weather API to compile and graph weather data from 1,000 randomly selected cities, and performed linear regression analysis to determine which weather conditions are correlated with latitude
# Utilized the Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy Python libraries to efficiently clean and analyze responses to an Amazon consumer behavior survey, allowing for purchasing trends to be discovered and visualized
# Wrote SQL queries to retrieve information from a database and join necessary tables, allowing for database data to be easily analyzed without altering the stored data itself
# Utilized the Flask and SQLAlchemy Python libraries to create an application to retrieve temperature and precipitation data from an SQLite database, making accessing the data less time consuming and more efficient
# This is not an all inclusive list, please check out my repositories for more info
