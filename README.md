# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### The work currently on this GitHub is from my time as a student in the Northwestern Data Science and Visualization Certificate program. Please check out my repositories to see some of the cool assignments and projects I have worked on

## About me
I graduated with a biochemistry degree from Valparaiso University in 2022. 
After attending a year of chemistry graduate school at Indiana University, I realized that I enjoyed working with data more than running experiments in the lab.
Thus, I left graduate school and enrolled in the Northwestern Data Science bootcamp. 
It has been the best decision of my life! 
I enjoy coding and working with data, and there is nothing more satifying than when the code finally works and outputs what you want.
I started working as a Business Intelligence Analyst at Gaylor Electric in May 2024.

## Bootcamp summary
### In the Northwestern Data Science bootcamp, I have:
  -Created a VBA script to analyze stock data in Excel and apply formatting, saving time on the data analysis for large Excel datasets with multiple sheets.
  
  -Used Python and the Open Weather API to compile and graph weather data from 1,000 randomly selected cities, and performed linear regression analysis to determine which weather conditions are correlated with latitude
 
  -Employed the Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy Python libraries to efficiently clean and analyze responses to an Amazon consumer behavior survey, allowing for purchasing trends to be discovered and visualized.

  -Written SQL queries to retrieve information from a database and join necessary tables, allowing for database data to be easily analyzed without altering the stored data itself

  -Utilized the Flask and SQLAlchemy Python libraries to create an application to retrieve temperature and precipitation data from an SQLite database, making accessing the data less time consuming and more efficient
  
  -Designed random forest and logistic regression machine learning models to predict housing prices in Chicago based off data from the Cook County Assessors office

## Previous work experience
### Founder of DarkfireBricks (2020 - Current)
As a side hobby, I founded an online store selling used Lego that has grossed $10,000 in revenue.
After starting out on Ebay, I decided to shift to Mercari in 2021 due to its ease of listing items and decreased competition.
I have completed 110+ orders on Mercari with an average order value (AOV) of $67.04.
The store receives an average of 144 item views per day.

### Associate Instructor at Indiana University (2022 - 2023)
I led an undergraduate organic chemistry laboratory section of 16 students, providing them with hands-on laboratory experience and ensuring that all EH&S waste disposal guidelines and safety protocols were followed in the teaching lab. I also held office hours, assisted with the lecture, and graded for organic chemistry I.

### Undergraduate Researcher at Valparaiso University (2021)
I designed procedures for steps in the synthesis of potential pterin antifungal compounds to make developing and testing derivatives more efficient.
One of my favorite parts of my research was analyzing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data to optimize experimental conditions such as temperature and solvent, which led to higher yield and quicker reaction times.
