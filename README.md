# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I am a student in the Northwestern Data Science and Visualization Bootcamp
### Please check out my repositories to see some of the cool assignments and projects I have worked on as a part of the class

## About me
I graduated with a biochemistry degree from Valparaiso University in 2022. 
After attending a year of chemistry graduate school at Indiana University, I realized that I enjoyed working with data more than running the experiments in the lab
Thus, I left graduated school and enrolled in the Northwestern Data Science bootcamp. 
It has been the best decision of my life! 
I enjoy coding and working with data, and there is nothing more satifying than when your code finally works and outputs what you want.

## Bootcamp summary
### In the Northwestern Bootcamp, I have:
-Created a VBA script to analyze stock data in Excel and apply formatting, saving time on the data analysis for large Excel datasets with multiple sheets.
-Used Python and the Open Weather API to compile and graph weather data from 1,000 randomly selected cities, and performed linear regression analysis to determine which weather conditions are correlated with latitude
-Utilized the Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy Python libraries to efficiently clean and analyze responses to an Amazon consumer behavior survey, allowing for purchasing trends to be discovered and visualized.
-Written SQL queries to retrieve information from a database and join necessary tables, allowing for database data to be easily analyzed without altering the stored data itself
-Utilized the Flask and SQLAlchemy Python libraries to create an application to retrieve temperature and precipitation data from an SQLite database, making accessing the data less time consuming and more efficient

## Previous work experiences outside of Data Analytics
### Founder of DarkfireBricks (2020 - Current)
As a side hobby, I started an online store selling used Lego that has grossed $10000 in revenue.
After starting out on Ebay, I decided to shift to Mercari in 2021 due to its ease of listing and decreased competition.
I have completed 110+ orders on Mercari with an average order value (AOV) of $67.04.
The store receives an average of 144 item views per day, though this number is lower than usual with a lull in new items listed over the holidays.

## Associate Instructor at Indiana University (2022 - 2023)
I led an undergraduate organic chemistry laboratory section of 16 students, providing them with hands-on laboratory experience and ensuring that all EH&S waste disposal guidelines and safety protocols were followed in the teaching lab.

## Undergraduate Researcher at Valparaiso University (2021)
I designed procedures for steps in the synthesis of potential pterin antifungal compounds to make developing and testing derivatives more efficient.
One of my favorite parts of my research was analyzing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data to optimize experimental conditions such as temperature and solvent, which led to higher yield and quicker reaction times.

## Education
